    <h1>Ftp Guide</h1>
    <p>My go to FTP client is <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, as it is Open source and avalible on MacOS, Linux, and Windows; and its really easy to set up as well!</p>
   <p>I mainly use FTP to transfer ripped roms from my New 2DS xl to my pc as it makes it really convenient to not have to take out the Micro SD card every time. For that application I use <a href="https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd">FTPD</a> </p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Run your software of choice</p>
    <p>Aquire server information, you will need the following:</p>
    <li>Host - This will be a website or an IP address.</li>
    <li>Port - this will be the number after an IP or Directory, Host.website.com:Port </li>
    <li>Username - Username that you login to the server with. These are not always required. only really used to manage who gets acces to the server in the first place.</li>
    <li>Password - On a server that needs a Username you will probably need a password with it.</li>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Heres easy the part, Take all the provided information above into the corresponding boxes. Then press connect.</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Download away! Its really that simple, if you truely wanted you could delve a lot deeper in regards to security and privacy but i just wanted to make a simple guide.</p>
<p>I personally reccomend when doing any sort of P2P Downloading running a VPN however its nothing thats required.</p>
