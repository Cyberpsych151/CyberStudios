    <h2>Emulators - My personal favorite emulators </h2>
    <p>All of these files will still need <a href="https://myrient.erista.me/">roms</a>, which <i>I</i> can't provide ;)</p>
    <h3>Best all around emulator</h3>
    <li><a href="https://www.retroarch.com">RetroArch [OpenSource]</a> - Several cores for a multitude of devices, Runs on most devices; Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS</li>
    <h3>iOS</h3>
    <li><a href="https://deltaemulatorapp.com/">Delta</a> - Retro Nintendo emulator for iOS. Runs NES, SNES N64, GBC, GBA, DS</li>
    <p>Honestly My experience with Delta has been poor, Not due to the software itself but because of all the restrictions Apple put on their devices.</p>
    <p>You have to setup AltStore on both your pc and iOS device and refresh it every 7 days, and if you forget to do that you will be locked out of it. </p>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/Lemuroid">Lemuroid [OpenSource]</a> - Retro Emulator for android with vast support for older systems</li>
    <p>In my experience it was really easy to setup, took like 10 minutes to figure things out and it handles really well. As soon as I get rid of my iPhone I'm Switching to Lemuroid. </p>
