<p>‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ I created this website because I didn't want to present an essay in front of the whole class, I thought it would be far easier for me to learn HTML and make a website than to present infront of all my classmates. Turns out I actually really enjoy working in HTML, so I have set out to build and manage a website even after the project was over. I really like teaching and love the idea of making tutorials about the things Im passionate about. and as time goes on and I continue to build this website i will also hone my skills. I have several project that I would love to get around to such as making mods, and developing games. As I develop said projects I would love to have a place to document my progress as well!</p>
